This test tests mathematical ability. Numbers will appear one by one, and users will be asked to choose the correct answer in the end. Level of difficulty increases every 8 questions.
Download the whole directory (Maths_Test), ensure they are in the same folder.
Open MAT.ipynb, press "restart kernel and run all cells" to run test.
note: Group_maths.ipnyb is the v1 code. I renamed the file prior to the final submission, so it doesn't rewrite the v1 codes.
