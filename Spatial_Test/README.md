This is the spatial reasoning test. There is a total of 12 questions and each question will come with 4 answers to choose from. From the folder 'Version 2 Spatial Reasoning Test', download the cube images 1-12 and the file named 'v2Final Spatial Reasoning Test.ipynb'. To run the test, open v2Final Spatial Reasoning Test.ipynb, press "restart the kernel and run all cells". Note: v2Appendix_for_cubes.ipynb contains the code that were used to create the 3D cube arrangements but it is not required to run the test.
